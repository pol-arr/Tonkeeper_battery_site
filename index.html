              covers the fee of a simple TON transfer transaction. More complex

              You can charge the battery with one tap using in-app purchases, or
              with TON or stablecoins. Send a few dollars worth of stablecoins
              or TON to a special address: battery.ton and it will automatically
              <span class="blue-text">apply charges</span> to your account.
